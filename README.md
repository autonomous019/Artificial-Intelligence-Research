# Artificial-Intelligence-Research
notes and coding examples for artificial intelligence research, machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning

You will find code examples. for instance MNIST training using tensorflow.js,  linear regression examples are also provided using tensorflow.js and python scikit learn.  Also see linked gist examples in the wiki.  

This repository currently is comprised of the wiki, link is above. A collection of articles and howto's on AI for software engineers, kinda like how to build a car if your a mechanic level of writing.
